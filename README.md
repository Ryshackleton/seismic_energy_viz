# Global Daily Earthquakes using Leaflet and D3.js
#### An example of using D3.js to display a several of the daily earthquake [feeds](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) from the USGS, along with some notable historical earthquakes on a Leaflet slippy map.

##### The animation shows the order of earthquakes in the viewing area (not scaled by the actual time between earthquakes).  The background map is a the ESRI Ocean Basemap, which has global bathymetry.  Smaller (lower magnitude) earthquakes are only displayed for specific regions as determined by the USGS data feed.
